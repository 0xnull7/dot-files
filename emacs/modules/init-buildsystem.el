;;; init-buildsystem.el --- Modes for build systems and config files -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;; Configures modes for Docker, Groovy (Jenkinsfiles), CMake, Bazel, and YAML.

;;; Code:

;; --- General Build System Modes ---
;; For each mode, we use the :mode keyword to ensure it's only loaded when
;; a relevant file is opened. This is more performant than a generic :defer.

(use-package dockerfile-mode
  :straight t
  :mode "Dockerfile\\'") ;; Regex needs to match the whole filename for exact match

(use-package groovy-mode
  :straight t
  :mode "\\.groovy\\'")

(use-package cmake-mode
  :straight t
  :mode "\\.cmake\\'")

(use-package bazel
  :straight t
  :mode ("\\.bzl\\'" . bazel-mode)
  ;; Add any specific bazel-mode configurations here if needed.
  ;; For instance:
  ;; :config
  ;; (add-hook 'bazel-mode-hook #'lsp-deferred) ; if using LSP for Bazel
  )

;; --- YAML Mode with Enhancements ---
(use-package yaml-mode
  :straight t ; Ensure `yaml-mode` is installed by straight.el
  :mode
  (("\\.yml\\'" . yaml-mode)
   ("\\.yaml\\'" . yaml-mode))

  (setq yaml-indent-offset 2)
  (setq yaml-tab-width 2)

  (setq indent-tabs-mode nil) ; Prefer spaces
